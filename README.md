Experiments with writing fragment shaders, using a video texture. Currently unoptimised, and not in very gpu style..
see here: http://experiments.playdo.io/animation-shaders/ <br><br>
To use the code, <br>
Create a video folder with videos named 0.mp4, 1.mp4 etc. <br>
Update scripts/main.js with number of videos.<br> 
Videos should have dimensions to the power of 2
